This document provides an essential introduction into the methodology of Mob Programming. For more detailed explanation use the recommended Links as guidance.

# What is Mob Programming?
Mob Programming is an generalisation of Pair Programming meaning that the whole team is working on one User Story while programming only on one Computer. It evolved from the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology.
In addition to software development this includes activities such as defining and refining user stories, testing, documenting and deploying software. Internal or external stakeholders can join as wanted or required.

When it comes to software coding the Driver Navigator Pattern is used. Also the practice Test Driven Development is highly recommended since it provides a clear incremental approach how the requirements are tackled for development.

## Driver Navigator Pattern
The driver navigator pattern stems from pair programming. With this pattern you have two roles, the driver and the navigator. The driver using the computer and writing the code. The navigator describes what needs to be developed and reviews the code that is being developed.

In Mob Programming you have one driver and the rest of the team are navigators. All navigators should focus on the current task and try to provide their input for the driver.

The roles are rotated regularly for example every 15 minutes. The regular switch of roles provides that anti patterns such as a self navigating driver is disrupted.

## Is Mob Programming remotely possible?


It is recommended to be in the same space with mob programming. But being a remote only does not mean that Mob Programming is not possible.

When being remote having a good video teleconference tool is necessary, since it is recommended to not only see the code that is being written, but also faces of the participants with good quality and minimised delay.

## How can it even be efficient?
The promoters of Mob Programming are convinced that it is even more efficient than full asynchronous teams. The reasoning is that when work split up to the team, then not all of the team are working on the same most important user story.

And with team members split up to different stories delays are created, when questions arise between them or code reviews are demanded. This implies that the most important user story is delayed by less important stories.

# Requirements
Mob Programming needs:

* a agile team that

** is cross functional including product owner, UI/UX designer and scrum master has all the abilities for the user story,

** and has access to the stakeholder, domain experts or users

* somewhat similar work time

* all participants try the methodology voluntarily

## Benefits
Mob Programming provides:

* Know-How- and Skill-Gaps are narrowed continuously
* the team learns from each other continuously
* Meetings can be done on demand
* Meetings such Planning or Retrospectives can be done on demand
* The daily meeting is redundant with mob programming
* “Development flow” / Less delay
** the User Story with the highest prioritisation is being developed without delays
** Continues review of code and perspectives

## Drawbacks
Mob Programming has:

* psychological barriers
  * participants needs to be open for it
  * participants can be too dominant (the others feel that they don't have the space to talk)
  * participants can be too shy (underestimation of their input)
* synchronous work require the participants to align work schedule
