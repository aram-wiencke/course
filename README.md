That overview shall a general understanding. We are going to provide code examples ... and will relate the theory with real world use cases.

There are a lot of resource about how to implement or use a concept on technology perspective or resouces that explain a concept only in theory.
This course tries to provide an introduction and overview about different concepts that every software engineer should know.
